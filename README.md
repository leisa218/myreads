# MyReads Project - FEND React Project for Udacity's Nanodegree

This is the example Project from the FEND Udacity Nanodegree build in React.

Based on a starter code we should create a MyReads App. 

## Install 
- Clone this respository
- cd into myreads directory
- Run npm install in the root directory
- Run npm start to start the server
- React will open the App on https://localhost:3000

## Run Application from build
- Copy build folder from this repository to your server or a local webserver
- Open the index.html file in the build folder

## Surge Preview
- Open http://dysfunctional-sheet.surge.sh/ to see the application in action.
- Note: Due to surge limitations the 404-page that the app contains does not work on surge.

## Features and Goals

### Application Setup

- [x] Application should be easy to install (npm install)
- [x] Application should include a README.md with clear instructions to install and launch (see this file)

### Main Page

- [x] Main Page should show three categories for books (currently reading, want to read, read)
- [x] Main Page allow user to move books between shelfs
- [x] Information persists between page refresh

### Search Page

- [x] Search page provide an input field that allows the user to search for books
- [x] Result allows the user to add a book to a shelf
- [x] Selections made on search show up on Main page

### Routing

- [x] Main Page link to Search page
- [x] Search Page links to Main page
- [x] History is working and user is able to hit the back button in browser

### Code Functionality

- [x] Project handle state correctly
- [x] JSX is formatted correctly


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
